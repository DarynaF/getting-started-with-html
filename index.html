<h1> Basic but important knowledges </h1>
<b> <em> Shortenings </em> </b>
<p> <b>HTML</b>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">Hypertext Markup Language</a>, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. </p>
<p> <b>HTTP </b>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol.</a> HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. </p>
<h2> Tags and Elements </h2>
<p> To work with HTML you need to use some particular tags to express what you want in your text. <em>You shouldn't be worried about to remember them all </em> because you can always <a href = " http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">look up for them.</a> </p>
<h3> Attentiveness </h3>
<p> As we know know computers mihgt be <em>stupid</em> sometimes but everything is in your hands. Think about what you is writing <b>correctly</b> because your computer will understand you <b>very exactly</b>. And small typo can cause big problems.</p>
<p><b>Inline or Block</b> <br>
  
  HTML elements can be <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the informtion which you puted in them. </p>
